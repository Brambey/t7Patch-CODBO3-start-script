# t7Patch-CODBO3-start-script
This is a portable batch and .vbs file that launches T7Patch.exe with codbo3.
The purpose of this is so you dont have to click two icons to play (im lazy lol).
The .vbs file is to start the batch script whithout it showing a terminal.
The batch script is used to start COD through steam and T7Patch at the same time. You can use just the batch file if you like open terminals. 
You MUST place both scripts in the same folder as the T7Patch exe file
